IDS
Intrusion detection system (IDS) is software that runs on servers or network devices to monitor and track network activity. By using IDS, network administrators can configure the system to monitor network activity for suspicious behavior that could indicate unauthorized access attempts

 
IPS
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) such as IDS follow the same process to collect and identify data and behavior, with the additional ability to block (prevent) the activity. Network-Based IPS (NIPS) can detain and inspect all network traffic for suspicious behavior and code. Because it uses in-line models, high performance is a crucial element of the IPS device to prevent a bottleneck on the network. Therefore, NIPS is usually designed using three components to accelerate performance of bandwidth, among others Network Chips (network processor), Chips FPGA, ASIC Chips
 
Conclusion
IDS serves to detect the activity of networks running on the server while the IPS serves to take precautions such as blocking or giving an access to a network
