Cryptography is a science to maintain data security when data transmission from the sender to akhirya to kepenerima maintained keamanaannya without someone who changed the authenticity of the data, this cryptography scrambles data so a hard person to read. There are two stages of cryptography
1. Encode is to change the data into the form of a unique code that is hard to read and requires a key to open the data
2. Decode is changing the unique code into the data are biased to be read
Conclusion
Cryptography is the scrambling of data becomes unreadable to an unauthorized person in an unbiased open data
